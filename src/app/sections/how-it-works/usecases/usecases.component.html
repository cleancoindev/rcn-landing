            <h3>USE CASES</h3>
            <h6>ORIGINATOR-BACKED LOANS</h6>
            <p>To better protect creditors loans are backed by an Originator, an entity responsible for defining interest rates, performing KYC and scoring assessments, managing collection services and securing buyback guarantee in case of default. Originator-backed loans are first requested by a Borrower to an Originator, which then broadcasts them to the decentralized marketplace for a Creditor to fund them. </p>

              <h6>CRYPTO-COLLATERAL-BACKED LOANS</h6>
              <p>In the absence of an Originator, a Borrower can request loans with different durations, interest rates, LTV ratios and amortization schedules directly on the decentralized marketplace by offering cryptocurrency as collateral. The collateralized funds are stored on a non-custodial escrow smart-contract, guaranteeing their security until the loan is repaid.</p>

                <p>The Loan Life Cycle describes all the different actions that a borrower and a lender might perform on a loan contract, and the related status it acquires after each of them.</p>

                  <h3>RCN TOKEN</h3>
                  <p>The RCN token is an Ethereum smart-contract that sits at the heart of the RCN protocol, acting as a vehicle that allows value to seamlessly travel through the blockchain across borders and between currencies. Using a series of Liquidity Pools, the funds provided by a lender in crypto or local fiat currency can be exchanged by RCN, broadcasted to the blockchain and finally exchanged again for the borrowerâ€™s currency of choice. The whole transaction takes place in just a few seconds and does not involve any fees, regardless of where the lender and the borrower might be at the time of the operation. Moreover, as the funds are never stored in proprietary third-party wallets, security and transparency are guaranteed at every step of the process.
